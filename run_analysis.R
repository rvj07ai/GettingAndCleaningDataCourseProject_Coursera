# Please note that data sets have been downloaded into the present Working directory 
# run_analysis.R script performs the following:

# 1. Merging the train and the test data sets to create one data set.

trainX <- read.table("train/X_train.txt")
testX <- read.table("test/X_test.txt")
X <- rbind(trainX, testX)

trainS <- read.table("train/subject_train.txt")
testS <- read.table("test/subject_test.txt")
S <- rbind(trainS, testS)

trainY <- read.table("train/y_train.txt")
testY <- read.table("test/y_test.txt")
Y <- rbind(trainY, testY)

# 2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

features <- read.table("features.txt")
indices_of_good_features <- grep("-mean\\(\\)|-std\\(\\)", features[, 2])
X <- X[, indices_of_good_features]
names(X) <- features[indices_of_good_features, 2]
names(X) <- gsub("\\(|\\)", "", names(X))
names(X) <- tolower(names(X))

# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

activities <- read.table("activity_labels.txt")
activities[, 2] = gsub("_", "", tolower(as.character(activities[, 2])))
Y[,1] = activities[Y[,1], 2]
names(Y) <- "activity"

# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.

names(S) <- "subject"
cleaned <- cbind(S, Y, X)
write.table(cleaned, "merged_clean_data.txt")

# 5. Creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

uniqueSubjects = unique(S)[,1]
